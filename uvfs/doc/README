FUSE based Audit filesystem  - very crude implementation - use at your own risk
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Works only on Linux (with FUSE) for now ...
----------------------------

1) HOWTO mount/umount:

   - Make sure that your executible (say uvfs)  is in PATH.
   - for mount:  mount.fuse <executible_name> <destination_dir>
   - for umount: fusermount -u  <destination_dir>

       	Example : 
     		mount.fuse uvfs -o  rootdir=/tmp/myroot  /tmp/mount

What it does:
   - Mirrors the directory given by rootdir= option into the mount point.
     (If there is no root option provided, mirrors the / dir)

   - How to do Auditing:
                You specifiy the pid by putting that into the /mount_point/.audit file.
                This is a special file (RAM based) which only takes data into a certain format.
                Just append the pid using echo command like this:
                     echo "1234" >> mount_point_full_path/.audit

                You can later see the content using "cat mount_point_full_path/.audit"

                Note - Don;t do any other operation other that this echo and cat on this file.
                       This is still work-in-progress :)
          
              Now, look into the file /tmp/audit.log for audit data.
              Format of the data is "a_pid|pid|action|path" 

Enjoy !
More to come later ...
