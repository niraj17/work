Requirement from FUSE subsystem:
-------------------------------
  1) Should provide a way to know the context (pid) where the particular
  request originated. (like fuse_get_context API)

  2) Need a way (API) to find the parent pid from a given pid. (On Linux, 
      this can be done by parsing /proc files - race conditions??)



Which version of FUSE to support:
-----------------------------
   To consider - 1) Supports in distro 2) Features requirement 

     - RHEL 5.4  and RHEL 6 has fuse version 2.7.4. 
     - SLES 10 SP2 and SLES 11 ships with FUSE version 2.7.2
     - Ubuntu 9.04 ships with FUSE 2.7.4

     - ioctl support came with FUSE version 2.8.0 (kernel version 2.6.29 ) 


Design thoughts:
---------------------

 - Fuse library is multithreaded by default (unless you pass the single thread
	 option - "-s"),
   so we don't need to create our own thread, but we need to write code which is thread safe.
   (by taking proper locks)

 - Should we be using "futex" ?? (See http://people.redhat.com/drepper/futex.pdf )

 - Use the "at" series of system calls, like openat

 - Loopback files/dir : what should be the strategy ??

    Use shared mount feature - http://lwn.net/Articles/159077/

 - 

 - The audit mechanism is based on pid appending to .audit (till we start
	 using 2.8.0) . Is it prone to
 race conditions or other abnormalities ...???

FUSE interface : lowlevel vs highlevel:
----------------------------------------
  - NFS export has problems with highlevel interface
