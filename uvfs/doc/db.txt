BerkeleyDB vs  Mysql:
------------------------
  - BDB has no sql processing, so less overhead
  - BDB has no client/server  (although might need client server for final product)
  - BDB has no column type, can directly map struct from the code into the data from
  the database

------------------------------

BDB database schema:
-------------------
 BDB stores key/value pairs

     "key" is relative path of the target (relative to workspace dir)
     "value" contains dependency info + workspace info

     Note that one key will have multiple values, one for each workspace

---------------------------------

Winkin logic design: 
===================
  1) Should not record dependency on something created during the build
  2) Make sure max record of dependent is not exceeded
