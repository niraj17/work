int i = 0xabcdef12; 32bit integer
char c = 'A';
int p = ; 0-3


char *cc = &i;
cc = cc + p;
*cc = c;

cal you call back ?. when I call, it seems, I can't hear you properly.
Let me call you then. I will call now.



unsigned int k = (unsigned int ) c;
k = k << p * 8;
unsigned int j = ~ (0xFF << p * 8);
            
i = i & j;
i = i & k;
